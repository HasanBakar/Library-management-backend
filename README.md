## Description

The Library Management Backend project is a robust system designed to streamline and manage library operations. Built using Node.js and MongoDB, it provides efficient handling of tasks such as book inventory management, user authentication, and authorization. The backend system ensures secure access to library resources, facilitates user management, and supports real-time data processing for seamless operations. This project aims to enhance library management by offering a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly backend solution tailored to modern libraries' needs.

### Technology Stack

**Programming Languages and Runtime:**

- **Node.js:** The primary runtime for executing JavaScript code on the server side.
- **TypeScript:** Used for adding static types to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

**Frameworks and Libraries:**

- **Express:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, managing relationships between data, schema validation, and more.

**Authentication and Authorization:**

- **bcryptjs:** A library to help hash passwords and ensure secure authentication.
- **jsonwebtoken:** A library to create and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for secure user authentication.

**Middleware:**

- **body-parser:** Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.
- **cors:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the backend to handle requests from different origins.

**Environment Management:**

- **dotenv:** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

**Development Tools:**

- **nodemon:** A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server.
- **TypeScript Compiler (tsc):** Transpiles TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- **ESLint:** A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter to ensure consistent code style.
- **@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin & @typescript-eslint/parser:** Integrates ESLint with TypeScript.

**Type Definitions:**

- **@types/body-parser, @types/cors, @types/express, @types/node, @types/bcryptjs, @types/jsonwebtoken, @types/mongoose:** Type definitions for the respective libraries, ensuring proper TypeScript support.

**Build and Watch Scripts:**

- **build:** Compiles TypeScript code using the TypeScript compiler.
- **watch:** Continuously watches for changes in TypeScript files and recompiles them.
- **dev:** Uses nodemon to run the development server, automatically restarting on file changes.
- **serve:** Runs the compiled JavaScript code.
- **lint:** Runs ESLint to check for code quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **format:** Uses Prettier to format the codebase.

This comprehensive technology stack provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend solution for managing library operations, ensuring security, efficiency, and ease of development.
